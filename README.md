# Pokemon - Clean Architecture(Flutter)

## BeAware 

## Why Clean Architecture?
## Pros 
* The most powerful software design
* Promotes the separation of concerns
* Highly maintainable, testable and flexible
* Divide codebase into independent layers that communicate through defined interfaces.
* Learning ability of concepts and principle increase

## Cons
* Need more planning and design
* Complexity increase (in small projects)
* Time consuming

# When To Use?
* To practice the new way of building the complex and highly maintanable application
* When to create complex and robust projects
* When having multi-concerns in one project

## *-----Now When You finally Dicided to go with Clean Architecture-----*
## Lets Gets Started

## Skeleton
Presentation: 
* UI & UX 
    * Pages
    * Provider (State management : BLOC , Riverpod...)
    * Widgets
Business(Domain): 
* Logics, implementation details, logs, exeptions, rules
    * entities
    * repositories 
    * usecases
Data: 
* Internal & external data (api / datastore)
    * datasources (Remote/Locale)
    * models
    * repositories

## Let's Divide & Rule over it ðŸ”¨ 

* Let's be more specific to our project now!
 
## Presentation layer 

* Handles the landing Screen which shows the pokemon image, name and properties.
* Also holds the state management tool (Provider). There are multiple state management libraries, but will discuss some more commonly used like Riverpod, Provider, Bloc etc.
* Widgets are the visible Ui components used in the primary Ui screens, widget is a fundamental building block of your user interface. 

                           Pages 
                            ðŸ‘‡ 
                          Widgets -> (Click the button)
                            ðŸ‘‡ 
                    <-     Entity    ->
               Yes                       No
                ðŸ‘‡                        ðŸ‘‡   
           Show Widget              <- Check for Failure ->
                                Yes                         No
                                ðŸ‘‡                          ðŸ‘‡ 
                           error Message               show Loading



* The logic is to either get entity(data) or failure.


## Domain Layer (Business)

* You can say, it's a bridge between the presentation and the data layer. 

                    Input from Ui(events)
                           ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘† 
                         Usecases
                           ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘†  
            Triggers the repositories (using entity)
                           ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘† 
                        Data Layer


## Data Layer (Data source)

* Responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data.
* In our application,we are getting the data from api and saving to local storage. 

                      Domain
                       ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘† 
              Data (RepositoryImpl)
                       ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘† 
                  <- Internet ->
              Yes                No
               ðŸ‘‡                ðŸ‘‡ 
        Remote Repo. <------> Locale Repo.
            ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘†                  ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘†  
            APi                 DB/Cache

## Besides Skeleton - Need some more Imp stuff

Core : (Common for all modules)
* Connection (Network Info)
* Constants (Commanly use strings)
* Error (Exception/Error handling)
* Param (Holds data classes)

## ----- Now you are all set to build new feature----

### Lets make it more easy,

* I placed one template module inside the project, which boost up your journey.

### Some pre-define steps to make your new module 
* Create new copy of template.
* Convert Template into Feature. (Replace the template title from all over module)
* Flow
    - Provider (Add required params)
    - Pages (Widgets)
    - Datasources remote
    - Provider uses
